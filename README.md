2. Select "From an app manifest"
3. Select your Workspace
4. Paste this Yaml code:

```yaml
_metadata:
  major_version: 1
  minor_version: 1
display_information:
  name: edith
features:
  app_home:
    messages_tab_enabled: true
    messages_tab_read_only_enabled: false
  bot_user:
    display_name: edith
    always_online: true
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - app_mentions:read
      - channels:read
      - chat:write
      - im:history
      - im:write
      - mpim:history
      - reactions:read
      - reactions:write
      - users:read
      - files:write
      - team:read
settings:
  event_subscriptions:
    bot_events:
      - app_mention
      - message.im

```

5. Create the App!

12. start the bot!

## 2nd) Run the bot

### Option 1: run via go
1. install go
2. create a config.yaml (at least a slack token is required) or take a look in config.sample.yaml
3. go inside slack bot folder `cd slack-bot`
4. Edit slack token and slack auth token in config.yaml file
5. Run the bot server by `bash ./scripts/slack-bot.sh`


# Usage
**Note:** You have to invite the bot into the channel to be able to handle commands.
